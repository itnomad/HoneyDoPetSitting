The concept here comes from my history and the eclectic nature of my work and
life experiences. First of all I love animals. This mostly extends to dogs and
cats. Some people say I have a way with other animals as well including birds,
goats, and pigs. Mostly my experience is with dogs. I just think they are
wonderful animals. 
I worked as a carpenter for 22 years before going back to school to learn
programming and become proficient with computers. I then worked in the
internet industry for several years. The dot com bust made it necessary to
return to construction. Most of that work has been in the remodeling industry
working on small jobs directly for home and business owners.  -- here a link
